  <h3>
    It is crazy that I now have a blog. It is even crazier how much I am learning. I just have to keep moving forward. 4 hours here. 6 hours there. The support I have been getting is great. Even though things get get pretty tough outside the classroom with everything going on, I am still going to show up.
